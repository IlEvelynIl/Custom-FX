# Installing
1. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/IlEvelynIl/Custom-FX/releases) and grab the latest version's `custom-fx.zip` file.

1. Extract `custom-fx.zip` into the root of your BGamer folder.
    - Make sure you have [BGamer v0.7](https://cabconmodding.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-1-bgamer-t5-lan-offline-client-v0-7.6446/) installed, this may not work on older versions.

1. Extract all `.iwi` files from the `main` folder of your game into `custom_fx/linker/raw/images`, this is required for most fx files to work.
    - Alternatively, you can only extract the ones that your fx files depend on, however I recommend extracting all of them for beginners.

1. Get some custom fx files, these can be found in places such as [Reealithy's Patch Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da5s8PwkGZM).

1. Once you have found the fx files you want, simply drag them into your `custom_fx/your_fx_files` folder, and now they should appear ingame.
    - These must still be in their original folder structure, meaning `fx` would be the top one.
