# Installing
1. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/IlEvelynIl/Custom-FX/releases) and grab the latest version's `custom-fx.zip` file.

1. Extract `custom-fx.zip` into the root of your BGamer folder.
    - Make sure you have [BGamer v0.7](https://www.mediafire.com/file/u3rbvzamsaj5cmy/BGamer_T5_LAN_Client_by_IlEvelynIl.zip/file) installed, this may not work on older versions.

1. Get some custom fx files, these can be found in places such as [Reealithy's Patch Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da5s8PwkGZM).

1. Once you have found the fx files you want, simply drag them into your `custom_fx/your_fx_files` folder, and now they should appear ingame.
    - These must still be in their original folder structure, meaning `fx` would be the top one.
    - Some fx files may require an image, you would place those in `custom_fx/your_fx_files/images`, every fx file is different with which images it requires.
